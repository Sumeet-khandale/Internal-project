🚀 Overview
FlixShow allows users to:
Browse and book movies in different theaters
Manage payments, bookings, and notifications
Authenticate securely using JWT
Interact with resilient, discoverable microservices via an API Gateway

🛠 Used Tools & Purpose
Purpose	Project / Library
Microservices Communication	Spring Cloud OpenFeign / RESTTemplate
Config Management	Spring Cloud Config Server
Service Discovery	Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka / Consul
API Gateway	Spring Cloud Gateway
Database ORM	Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
Authentication	Spring Security + JWT 
Scheduling	@Scheduled with Redis TTL
Rate Limiting / Circuit Breaker	Resilience4j / Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker
Dev Tools	Spring Boot DevTools, Lombok
Testing	JUnit5, Mockito, Testcontainers
Logging	Logback + slj4
API Docs	SpringDoc OpenAPI / Swagger

🔐 Authentication (JWT)
Login Endpoint:
POST http://localhost:9998/api-gateway/authenticate -> to get a tooken

How to Use:
Pass user credentials to receive a JWT token.
Use the token for all protected endpoints:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
⚙️ Configuration Server
All service configurations are externalized and managed via a centralized Spring Cloud Config Server.

🔐 Authentication (JWT + DB-Based Validation)
POST  http://localhost:9998/api-gateway/authenticate – Validates user credentials from the database and returns a JWT token.  
Use the token in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for accessing protected endpoints.


How it works:
API Gateway reads from a file (/FILE/ceate.txt) containing allowed usernames.
If the provided username exists in the file, a JWT token is issued.
Use this token in the Authorization header for all protected routes.
